# k-CFA2 Tests Implementation Log

Date: 2023-07-06

## Overview

Test-driven development (TDD) scaffolding for the k-CFA2 pointer analysis has been implemented. The test suite covers the core data structures, context sensitivity, heap abstraction, and integration with the IR/TAC representation.

## Completed Work

1. **Core Test Structure**:
   - Implemented pytest fixtures in `conftest.py`
   - Created parameterized tests for k values (1 and 2)
   - Added helper functions for creating test objects

2. **Interface Tests**:
   - Verified imports of all required modules
   - Tested equality and hash invariants for core data structures
   - Validated field key uniqueness and validation rules
   - Confirmed points-to set operations (join, empty checks)

3. **Context Sensitivity Tests**:
   - Implemented tests for context creation, pushing, and popping
   - Verified k-limiting behavior for different k values
   - Tested recursive contexts and higher-order call chains
   - Validated context manager for tracking call/return

4. **Heap Model Tests**:
   - Confirmed allocation site abstraction principles
   - Tested context sensitivity for object allocation
   - Validated 2-object sensitivity with receiver contexts
   - Verified field addressing for different field types

5. **Call Handling Tests**:
   - Implemented tests for direct and indirect calls
   - Tested bound method calls with receiver objects
   - Verified closure calls with captured variables
   - Validated return flow from functions to callers

6. **Attribute Tests**:
   - Tested direct and dynamic attribute access
   - Verified field sensitivity for different types
   - Implemented tests for unknown attribute handling
   - Validated descriptor handling with conservative approach

7. **Builtin Function Tests**:
   - Implemented tests for common built-in functions
   - Tested container constructors and operations
   - Validated conservative handling of dynamic operations
   - Verified top object propagation

8. **CFG Integration Tests**:
   - Tested site ID generation from source locations
   - Implemented event extraction from IR/TAC nodes (xfailed)
   - Verified allocation and call event processing

9. **Documentation**:
   - Created soundness guidelines document with rules
   - Compiled test digest with scenario x expectation matrix
   - Documented known limitations and test configuration

## XFails and Gaps

1. **IR Adapter Integration**:
   - Tests marked as `xfail` since IR adapter is not fully implemented
   - Mock IR nodes created for testing until real IR is ready

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - No performance or scalability tests implemented yet
   - Future work should include benchmarks for analysis time

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Complex dynamic features like metaclasses need more tests
   - Exception handling tests are minimal

4. **Implementation Gaps**:
   - Top/Bottom values modeled in tests but not fully implemented
   - Some lattice operations (e.g., widening) not yet tested

## Next Steps

1. Complete IR adapter implementation to make xfailed tests pass
2. Implement core analysis engine using the test suite as guide
3. Add more complex test cases for Python-specific features
4. Benchmark performance and scalability with realistic programs
5. Integrate with the existing analysis pipeline
